          "question": "What is a TPM mandate?",
          "answer": "A Third Party Marketing (TPM) mandate is a distribution agreement where Alforis represents your asset management firm in specific markets (France, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal). We act as an extension of your team, opening doors with local distributors and institutional investors while you maintain full control over investment decisions and client relationships."
        },
        "remuneration": {
          "question": "How is compensation structured?",
          "answer": "Our model combines a monthly retainer (covering operational costs: travel, marketing, infrastructure) and a success fee on assets raised and/or mandates won. The retainer starts from â‚¬5K/month excluding VAT with a minimum 12-month commitment. Success fee details are tailored to your business model and discussed transparently during initial negotiations."
        },
        "timelines": {
          "question": "What are typical market access timelines?",
          "answer": "Institutional distribution is a marathon, not a sprint. First qualified meetings: 1-2 months. First due diligence processes: 3-6 months. First mandates/listings: 6-12 months. Significant traction: 18-24 months. These timelines vary based on your product complexity, track record, and market receptiveness."
        },
        "marketing": {
          "question": "What marketing materials should we provide?",
          "answer": "Essential: Factsheets, KIID/KID, fund presentations, track record reports, investment team bios. Recommended: Case studies, due diligence questionnaire responses, SFDR/ESG documentation. We help adapt these materials for local markets (translation, regulatory compliance, cultural nuances), but we need solid foundational materials to start from."
