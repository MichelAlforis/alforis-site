        "question": "What is a TPM mandate?",
        "answer": "A Third Party Marketing (TPM) mandate is a distribution agreement whereby Alforis represents your asset management company in specific markets (France, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal). We act as an extension of your team, opening doors with local distributors and institutional investors, while you maintain full control over investment decisions and client relationships."
      },
      "remuneration": {
        "question": "How is the compensation structured?",
        "answer": "Our model combines a monthly retainer (covering operational costs: travel, marketing, infrastructure) and a success fee on raised assets and/or won mandates. The retainer starts from â‚¬5K/month excl. VAT with a minimum commitment of 12 months. Success fee details are tailored to your business model and discussed transparently during initial negotiations."
      },
      "timelines": {
        "question": "What are the average market access timelines?",
        "answer": "Institutional distribution is a marathon, not a sprint. First qualified meetings: 1-2 months. First due diligence processes: 3-6 months. First mandates/listings: 6-12 months. Significant traction: 18-24 months. These timelines vary depending on your product complexity, track record and market receptivity."
      },
      "marketing": {
        "question": "What marketing materials should be provided?",
        "answer": "Essential: Factsheets, KIID/KID, fund presentations, track record reports, investment team biographies. Recommended: Case studies, due diligence questionnaire responses, SFDR/ESG documentation. We help adapt these materials for local markets (translation, regulatory compliance, cultural nuances), but we need solid base materials to start."
